         This might be a universal law in some ways, we all know everyone could made
         awful decision on their lifestyle, and as a result,  when they realize how
         terrible these choices are, people also tend to find so called reasonable
         explanation for the their behavior, which we also called excuses. Sadly,
         I am one of these people too, and I wish to make a difference to myself
         by showing how ridicules I am for blaming an irrelevant cause for my issue.
         In this data project, I will present my mostly comely used excuse for overindulging
         into my phone, the weather.
